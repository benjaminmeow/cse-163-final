# A Quantitative Analysis of Songs on Spotify

## Research Question 1: Do the songs with the most popular artists share a similar audio profile in terms of individual audio features? Does one audio feature seem to remain the most constant among these songs?

We decided to create plots to represent our findings using a new library of plotly/. To reproduce these results, it is strongly recommended that you open up a Jupyter notebook or use Datalore.JetBrains.com to access plot displays and have an interactive environment to use plotly to its fullest potential. After choosing an environment to explore our visual analysis, make sure you implement these imports “” to prepare the plots to be displayed. The title of each plot image corresponds to a file of that same name that contains the code necessary to plot these visualizations. Transfer these files to the environment chosen from the two options above to create these plots in real time. Every file with the code to plot these plots contain comments explaining each step of the process and purpose of each line of code for readers to clearly follow. 

To start, download this project or clone it using:

```git clone ```

Then open Git or GitBash (depending on your operating system) to install the necessary libraries:

```pip install```

For the plot file labeled "question_1.py" the following imports are included:
```ruby
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.subplots as sp
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```


## Research Question 2: Will Spotify recommend a list of popular songs if we pass in audio feature parameters that are representative of already popular songs?


## Research Question 3: Can we predict a song’s popularity score based on its song’s audio features?
